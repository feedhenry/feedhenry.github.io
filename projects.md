In 2012, Red Hat launched its first mobile related research project, titled
[AeroGear]. AeroGear's goal is to provide flexible, extensible libraries and
server side components that simplify mobile development and infrastructure setup
across platforms.

In December 2015, the [UnifiedPush Server] from the AeroGear project was
integrated into FeedHenry. This provides FeedHenry users the ability to
send push notifications to any device, regardless of platform or network.

## Data Synchronization

A set of Mobile SDKs & Node.js module for client/server data synchronization with offline support.

</div>

<div class="project-text" markdown="1">

#### Overview

The FeedHenry Data Synchronization framework includes the following features:

* Allows mobile apps to use and update data offline (local cache)
* Provides a mechanism to manage bi-directional data synchronization from multiple Client Apps using the Cloud App and into back-end data stores
* Allows data updates (that is, deltas) to be distributed from the Cloud App to connected clients
* Enables data collision management from multiple updates in the cloud
* Allows Apps to seamlessly continue working when the network connection is lost, and allows them to recover when the network connection is restored.
